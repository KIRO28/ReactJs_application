Approach and challenges with solutions
As a developer learning and working on this ReactJS blog application with TypeScript, I approached the project by developing two main components: BlogList.tsx to show a list of blog posts and BlogDetail.tsx to display detailed information about each post. I used React Router to manage navigation between these components and utilized useEffect for fetching data and useState for managing state. Integrating TypeScript was a significant learning curve; I addressed it by defining precise interfaces for data structures, which enhanced type safety and minimized runtime errors. I faced challenges in managing state and ensuring smooth transitions between the list and detail views, which required careful handling of API responses and route parameters. Additionally, making the application responsive and user-friendly involved solving design challenges through effective CSS styling and layout management. This project provided valuable hands-on experience in building and refining React applications with TypeScript.
